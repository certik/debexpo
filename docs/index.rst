Welcome to debexpo's documentation
===================================

debexpo (Debian package exposition) is a web application that allows you to
run a user-friendly public Debian package repository with social interaction
that you may be used to from social networking sites. debexpo is the basis for
the mentors.debian.net site but may be useful for others as well. It is
basically a Pylons application that can be deployed on any server. You do
not need anything more than Pylons, a little harddisk space and a database
like PostgreSQL, MySQL or Sqlite.
