What is soaplib?
----------------

Soaplib is an easy to use python library written at 
[Optio Software, Inc.](http://www.optio.com/)
for writing and calling soap web services.  Writing soap web services in
any language has always been extremely difficult and yielded mixed
results.  With a very small amount of code, soaplib allows you to write
a useful web service and deploy it as a WSGI application.  WSGI is a python
web standard for writing portable, extendable web applications in python.
More information on WSGI can be found [here](http://wsgi.org/wsgi).

Features
--------
* deploy services as WSGI applications
* handles all xml (de)serialization
* on-demand WSDL generation
* doesn't get in your way!!!

Requirements
------------
* Python 2.4 or greater (tested mainly on 2.4.3)
* [ElementTree](http://effbot.org/downloads/elementtree-1.2.6-20050316.tar.gz) (available through easy_install)
* [cElementTree](http://effbot.org/downloads/cElementTree-1.0.5-20051216.tar.gz) (available through easy_install)
* a WSGI-compliant web server (CherryPy, WSGIUtils, Flup, etc.)
* [pytz](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/)(available through easy_install)
* [easy_install](http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py) (optional)
        
Intro Examples
==============
	
HelloWorld	
----------

This example uses the [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/) webserver to deploy this service

1. Declaring a Soaplib Service

		from soaplib.wsgi_soap import SimpleWSGISoapApp
		from soaplib.service import soapmethod
		from soaplib.serializers.primitive import String, Integer, Array
	
		class HelloWorldService(SimpleWSGISoapApp):
			@soapmethod(String,Integer,_returns=Array(String))
			def say_hello(self,name,times):
		        results = []
			        for i in range(0,times):
			            results.append('Hello, %s'%name)
			        return results
			
		if __name__=='__main__':
	   		from cherrypy._cpwsgiserver import CherryPyWSGIServer
		    server = CherryPyWSGIServer(('localhost',7789),HelloWorldService())
		    server.start()
	
	Dissecting this example:
	
	`SimpleWSGISoapApp` is the base class for WSGI soap services.
	
	 	from soaplib.wsgi_soap import SimpleWSGISoapApp
	
	The `soapmethod` decorator exposes methods as soap method and declares the
	data types it accepts and returns
	
		from soaplib.service import soapmethod
	
	Import the serializers to for this method (more on serializers later)
	
		from soaplib.serializers.primitive import String, Integer, Array
	
	Extending `SimpleWSGISoapApp` is an easy way to soap service that can
	be deployed as a WSGI application.
			
		class HelloWorldService(SimpleWSGISoapApp):

	The `soapmethod` decorator flags each method as a soap method, 
	and defines the types and order of the soap parameters, as well
	as the return value.  This method takes in a `String`, an `Integer`
	and returns an Array of Strings -> `Array(String)`. 
		
		@soapmethod(String,Integer,_returns=Array(String))

	The method itself has nothing special about it whatsoever. All
	input variables and return types are standard python objects.
	
		def say_hello(self,name,times):
	        results = []
		        for i in range(0,times):
		            results.append('Hello, %s'%name)
		        return results
		
2. Deploying the service		

	deploy this web service.  Soaplib has been tested with several other web servers, 
	This example uses the [CherryPy](http://www.cherrrypy.org) WSGI web server to 
	and any WSGI-compliant server *should* work.
	
		if __name__=='__main__':
	   		from cherrypy._cpwsgiserver import CherryPyWSGIServer
		    server = CherryPyWSGIServer(('localhost',7789),HelloWorldService())
		    server.start()

3. Calling this service
	
		>>> from soaplib.client import make_service_client
		>>> client = make_service_client('http://localhost:7789/',HelloWorldService())
		>>> print client.say_hello("Dave",5)
		['Hello, Dave','Hello, Dave','Hello, Dave','Hello, Dave','Hello, Dave']
		
	`soaplib.client.make_service_client` is a utility method to construct a callable 
	client to the remote web service.  `make_service_client` takes the url of the
	remote functionality, as well as a _stub_ of the remote service.  As in this case,
	the _stub_ can be the instance of the remote functionality, however the requirements
	are that it just have the same method signatures and definitions as the server 
	implementation. 

User Manager
------------

Lets try a more complicated example than just strings and integers!  The following is
an extremely simple example using complex, nested data.

	from soaplib.wsgi_soap import SimpleWSGISoapApp
	from soaplib.service import soapmethod
	from soaplib.serializers.primitive import String, Integer, Array
	from soaplib.serializers.clazz import ClassSerializer

	user_database = {}
	userid_seq = 1

	class Permission(ClassSerializer):
	    class types:
	        application = String
	        feature = String

	class User(ClassSerializer):
	    class types:
	        userid = Integer
	        username = String
	        firstname = String
	        lastname = String
	        permissions = Array(Permission)

	class UserManager(SimpleWSGISoapApp):

	    @soapmethod(User,_returns=Integer)
	    def add_user(self,user):
	        global user_database
			global userid_seq
	        user.userid = userid_seq
	        userid_seq = user_seq+1
	        user_database[user.userid] = user
	        return user.userid

	    @soapmethod(Integer,_returns=User)
	    def get_user(self,userid):
	        global user_database
	        return user_database[userid]

	    @soapmethod(User)
	    def modify_user(self,user):
	        global user_database
	        user_database[user.userid] = user

	    @soapmethod(Integer)
	    def delete_user(self,userid):
	        global user_database
	        del user_database[userid]

	    @soapmethod(_returns=Array(User))
	    def list_users(self):
	        global user_database
	        return [v for k,v in user_database.items()]

	if __name__=='__main__':
	    from cherrypy._cpwsgiserver import CherryPyWSGIServer
	    server = CherryPyWSGIServer(('localhost',7789),UserManager())
	    server.start()

Jumping into what's new:

	class Permission(ClassSerializer):
	    class types:
	        application = String
	        feature = String

	class User(ClassSerializer):
	    class types:
	        userid = Integer
	        username = String
	        firstname = String
	        lastname = String
	        permissions = Array(Permission)

The `Permission` and `User` structures in the example are standard python objects
that extend `ClassSerializer`.  The `ClassSerializer` uses an innerclass called
`types` to declare the attributes of this class.  At instantiation time, a 
metaclass is used to inspect the `types` and assigns the value of `None` to
each attribute of the `types` class to the new object.

	>>> u = User()
	>>> u.username = 'jimbob'
	>>> print u.userid
	None
	>>> u.firstname = 'jim'
	>>> print u.firstname
	jim
	>>> 

Serializers
===========
In soaplib, the serializers are the components responsible for converting indivdual
parameters to and from xml, as well as supply the information necessary to build the
wsdl.  Soaplib has many built-in serializers that give you most of the common datatypes
generally needed.

Primitives
----------
The basic primitive types are `String`, `Integer`, `DateTime`, `Null`, `Float`, `Boolean`.  These are some
of the most basic blocks within soaplib.  

	>>> from soaplib.serializers.primitive import *        
	>>> import cElementTree as et
	>>> element = String.to_xml('abcd','nodename')
	>>> print et.tostring(element)
	<nodename xsi:type="xs:string">abcd</nodename>
	>>> print String.from_xml(element)
	abcd
	>>> String.get_datatype()
	'string'
	>>> String.get_datatype(True)
	'xs:string'
	>>> 


Collections
-----------
The two collections available in soaplib are `Array`s and `Map`s.  Unlike the primitive 
serializers, both of these serializers need to be instantiated with the proper internal 
type so it can properly (de)serialize the data.  All `Array`s and `Map`s are homogeneous, 
meaning that the data they hold are all of the same type.  For mixed typing or more dynamic
data, use the `Any` type.

	>>> from soaplib.serializers.primitive import *
	>>> import cElementTree as et
	>>> array_serializer = Array(String)
	>>> element = array_serializer.to_xml(['a','b','c','d'])
	>>> print et.tostring(element)
	<xsd:retval SOAP-ENC:arrayType="xs:string[4]"><string xsi:type="xs:string">a</string><string xsi:type="xs:string">b</string><string xsi:type="xs:string">c</string><string xsi:type="xs:string">d</string></xsd:retval>
	>>> print array_serializer.from_xml(element)
	['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
	>>>

Class
-----
The `ClassSerializer` is used to define and serialize complex, nested structures.

	>>> from soaplib.serializers.primitive import *    
	>>> import cElementTree as et
	>>> from soaplib.serializers.clazz import *
	>>> class Permission(ClassSerializer):
	...	    class types:
	...	        application = String
	...	        feature = String
	>>>
	>>>	class User(ClassSerializer):
	... 	class types:
	...	        userid = Integer
	...	        username = String
	...	        firstname = String
	...	        lastname = String... 
	...	        permissions = Array(Permission)
	>>> 
	>>> u = User()
	>>> u.username = 'bill'
	>>> u.permissions = [] 
	>>> p = Permission()            
	>>> p.application = 'email'
	>>> p.feature = 'send'
	>>> u.permissions.append(p)
	>>> element = User.to_xml(u)
	>>> et.tostring(element)
	'<xsd:retval><username xsi:type="xs:string">bill</username><lastname xsi:null="1" /><userid xsi:null="1" /><firstname xsi:null="1" /><permissions SOAP-ENC:arrayType="typens:Permission[1]"><Permission><application xsi:type="xs:string">email</application><feature xsi:type="xs:string">send</feature></Permission></permissions></xsd:retval>'
	>>> User.from_xml(element).username
	'bill'
	>>>

Attachment
----------
The `Attachment` serializer is used for transmitting binary data as base64 encoded strings.
Data in `Attachment` objects can be loaded manually, or read from file.  All encoding of
the binary data is done just prior to the data being sent, and decoding immediately upon
receipt of the `Attachment`.

	>>> from soaplib.serializers.binary import Attachment
	>>> import cElementTree as et
	>>> a = Attachment(data='my binary data')
	>>> element = Attachment.to_xml(a)
	>>> print et.tostring(element)
	<xsd:retval>bXkgYmluYXJ5IGRhdGE=
	</xsd:retval>
	>>> print Attachment.from_xml(element)
	<soaplib.serializers.binary.Attachment object at 0x5c6d90>
	>>> print Attachment.from_xml(element).data
	my binary data
	>>> a2 = Attachment(fileName='test.data') # load from file


Any
---
The `Any` type is a serializer used to transmit unstructured xml data.  `Any` types are very
useful for handling dynamic data, and provides a very pythonic way for passing data using
soaplib.  The `Any` serializer does not perform any useful task because the data passed in
and returned are `Element` objects.  The `Any` type's main purpose is to declare its presence
in the `wsdl`.


Custom
------
Soaplib provides a very simple interface for writing custom serializers.  Any object conforming
to the following interface can be used as a soaplib serializer.

	class MySerializer:

	    def to_xml(self,value,name='retval'):
			pass
            
	    def from_xml(self,element):
			pass

	    def get_datatype(self,withNamespace=False):
			pass

	    def add_to_schema(self,added_params):
			pass

This feature is particularly useful when adapting soaplib to an existing project and converting existing
object to `ClassSerializers` is impractical.

Client
======
Soaplib provides a simple soap client to call remote soap implementations.  Using the `ServiceClient` object
is the simplest way to make soap client requests.  The `ServiceClient` uses an example or stub 
implementation to know how to properly construct the soap messages.

	>>> from soaplib.client import make_service_client
	>>> client = make_service_client('http://localhost:7789/',HelloWorldService())
	>>> print client.say_hello("Dave",5)

This method provides the most straightforward method of creating a SOAP client using soaplib.

Message API
===========
TODO

WSGI
====
All soaplib services can be deployed as WSGI applications, and this gives soaplib great flexibility
with how they can be deployed.  Any WSGI middleware layer can be put between the WSGI webserver and
the WSGI soap application.

Deployment
----------
Soaplib has been extensively used with [Paste](http://www.pythonpaste.org) for server configuration
and application composition.  

Hooks
-----
`WSGISoapApp`s have a set of extensible 'hooks' that can be implemented to capture different
events in the execution of the wsgi request.

	def onCall(self,environ):
	    '''This is the first method called when this WSGI app is invoked'''
	    pass

	def onWsdl(self,environ,wsdl):
	    '''This is called when a wsdl is requested'''
	    pass

	def onWsdlException(self,environ,exc,resp):
	    '''Called when an exception occurs durring wsdl generation'''
	    pass

	def onMethodExec(self,environ,body,py_params,soap_params):
	    '''Called BEFORE the service implementing the functionality is called'''
	    pass

	def onResults(self,environ,py_results,soap_results):
	    '''Called AFTER the service implementing the functionality is called'''
	    pass

	def onException(self,environ,exc,resp):
	    '''Called when an error occurs durring execution'''
	    pass

	def onReturn(self,environ,returnString):
	    '''Called before the application returns'''
	    pass

These hooks are useful for transaction handling, logging and measuring performance.

Servers
-------

Soaplib services can be deployed as WSGI applications, in any WSGI-compliant web server.  Soaplib
services have been successfully run on the following web servers:

* CherryPy 2.2
* Flup
