'''
This example is an enhanced version of the HelloWorld example that
uses service 'hooks' to apply cross-cutting behavior to the service.
In this example, the service hooks are used to gather performance 
information on both the method execution as well as the duration 
of the entire call, including serialization and deserialization. The
available hooks are:

    * onCall
    * onWsdl
    * onWsdlException
    * onMethodExec
    * onResults
    * onException
    * onReturn
    
These method can be used to easily apply cross-cutting functionality
accross all methods in the service to do things like database transaction
management, logging and measuring performance.  This example also 
employs the threadlocal request (soaplib.wsgi_soap.request) object
to hold the data points for this request.
